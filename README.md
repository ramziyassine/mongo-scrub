===========

### Introduction 
I am hoping to share with you what I have learned in 4-7 days. You should be able to run this on your machine 

### What is the big deal 
Following these instruction will show you how to run 2 different VMs on your machine, one will be production and the other will be a test machine. 
Both are running a mongodb server. In addition, I will show you how to backup one and push a scrubbed copy to the other machine.
